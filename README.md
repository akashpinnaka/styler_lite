```ruby
gem 'styler_lite'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install styler_lite

## Usage

In your _app/assets/stylesheets/application.css_, add the below line
```ruby
*= require 'styler_lite'
```

### For floating an element, use the following classes.
```html
<div class="float-left">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div is floated to left -->
<div class="float-right">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div is floated to left -->
<div class="no-float">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This removes float property to div if any -->
```

### Displays and visibilities of elements
```html
<div class="no-display">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div has display: none property -->
<div class="hide">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div's visibility is hidden -->
```

### Element positionings
```html
<div class="abs-pos">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div has a position of absolute -->
<div class="rel-pos">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div has a position of relative -->
<div class="fixed-pos">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div has a position of fixed -->
<div class="static-pos">Your content goes here...</div>  <!-- This div changes its position to static -->
```

### Clear fixing
If you have some floating elements like below
```html
<div class="float-left">First div content goes here...</div>
<div class="float-left">Second div content goes here...</div>
```

Modify the above structure to look like the following
```html
<div class="clear-fix">
    <div class="float-left">First div content goes here...</div>
    <div class="float-left">Second div content goes here...</div>
</div>
```
**Note:** You can wrap _clear-fix_ to any number of floats of any  type.
